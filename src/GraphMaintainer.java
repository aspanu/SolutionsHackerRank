/**
 * The GraphMaintainer contains all of the logic for the storage and maintenance of a graph
 * The graph representation itself is made to be as minimal as possible for the requirements
 * We do not store any structure of the graph beyond which nodes are connected to other nodes, including themselves
 * This means that 'removal' operations force us to recreate the entire history of the graph,
 * requiring us to store that history
 *
 * This architecture implies that:
 * 'add' operations are moderately fast [O(n)],
 * 'remove' operations are slow [O(n*l)]
 * 'isLinked' operations are fast [O(1)]
 *
 * This architecture also means that we have roughly O(n^2 + l) space complexity
 * The O(n^2) comes from the storage of the graph, where in the worst case, each node stores all nodes
 * The O(l) comes from the storage of the 'true' history - this is where every 'add' instruction which
 * hasn't been subsequently 'removed' is stored
